## OUTPUT
{'id': 12458, 'name': 'Paul', 'department': 'House Floor'}

# The code runs well and will return the user Paul, as its ID, 12458, is matched. 
# The challenge comes when the list gets bigger. 
# You could optimize the code to split the search, but even with this, it still lacks in performance in comparison to other data structures, such as the dictionary.
